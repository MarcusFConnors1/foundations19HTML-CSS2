        <p>I thought I had everybody on my side
            But I went and blew it all sky high
            And now she won't even spare a passing glance
            All just because I ripped my pants
            When big Larry came 'round just to put him down
            Spongebob turned into a clown
            And no girl ever wants to dance
            With a fool who went and ripped his pants
            I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse
            But the pain feels so much worse
            'Cause windin' up with no one is a lot less fun
            Than a burn from the sun or sand in your buns!
            Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget
            So listen, and you won't regret
            Be true to yourself, don't miss your chance
            And you won't end up like the fool
            Who ripped his pants</p>
        <p>Spongebob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!
            Plankton: What's that?

            Plankton:

            Should we stop?
            Spongebob:

            Plankton:
